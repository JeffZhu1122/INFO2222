        <h3><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the most popular consumer applications of AI today revolve around language. From chatbots to virtual assistants to predictive texting on smartphones, AI tools have been used to replicate human speech in a variety of formats. To do this effectively, developers call upon the knowledge of natural language processers—individuals who have both the language and technology skills needed to assist in the creation of these tools. “Natural language processing is applying machine learning to language,” Edmunds says. “It’s a really big field.”</span></p>
<p><b>Responsibilities: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As there are many </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/06/03/5-amazing-examples-of-natural-language-processing-nlp-in-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of natural language processing, the responsibilities of the experts in this field will vary. However, in general, individuals in these roles will use their complex understanding of both language and technology to develop systems through which computers can successfully communicate with humans.</span></p>
<p><b>Career Outlook: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a real shortage of people in these roles [today],” Edmunds says. “There are a bunch of [products] where we’re trying to interact with a machine through language, but language is really hard.” For this reason, those with the proper skill sets can expect an above-average salary and job outlook for the foreseeable future. The average annual salary for those with natural language processing skills is </span><a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Skill=Natural_Language_Processing_(NLP)/Salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$107,000 per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Education &amp; Training: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those hoping to pursue a career in natural language processing should consider a </span><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-science-in-computer-science-boston-5238/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">master’s degree in computer science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a specialization in human-computer interface.</span></p>
