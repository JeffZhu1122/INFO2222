        <h3><strong>Software Engineering</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AI field also relies on traditional </span><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/popular-master-in-computer-science-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">computer science roles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as software engineers to develop the programs on which artificial intelligence tools function.</span></p>
<p><b>Responsibilities: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software engineers are part of the overall design and development process of digital programs or systems. In the scope of AI, individuals in these roles are responsible for developing the technical functionality of the products which utilize machine learning to carry out a variety of tasks.</span></p>
<p><b>Career Outlook: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a growth rate of </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—much faster than average—by 2028 for software developers, including the addition of 284,100 jobs. Software engineers also make an average salary of </span><a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$84,336 per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with potential increases for those with a specialty in AI.</span></p>
<p><b>Education &amp; Training: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals hoping to achieve a successful career in software engineering should have a </span><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-science-in-computer-science-boston-5238/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">master’s degree in computer science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those looking to then design software specifically for AI should also consider programs with a concentration in artificial intelligence.</span></p>
