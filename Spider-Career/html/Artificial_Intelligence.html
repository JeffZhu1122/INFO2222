        <h3><strong>Computer Science Artificial Intelligence Research</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although many of these top careers explore the application or function of AI technology, computer science and artificial intelligence research is more about discovering ways to advance the technology itself. “There will always be somebody developing a faster machine,” Edmunds says. “There’s always going to be somebody pushing the edge, and that [person] will be a computer scientist.”</span></p>
<p><b>Responsibilities: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer science and artificial intelligence researcher’s responsibilities will vary greatly depending on their specialization or their particular role in the research field. Some may be in charge of advancing the data systems related to AI. Others might oversee the development of new software that can uncover new potential in the field. Others still may be responsible for overseeing the ethics and accountability that comes with the creation of such tools. No matter their specialization, however, individuals in these roles will work to uncover the possibilities of these technologies and then help implement changes in existing tools to reach that potential.</span></p>
<p><b>Career Outlook: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As these individuals are at the crux of advancement in AI, their job outlook is very positive.

Individuals in base-level AI research roles are likely to make an average salary of </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/research-scientist-ai-salary-SRCH_KO0,21.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$83,490 annually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Education &amp; Training: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the extensive need for a background in not only applied statistics but also mathematical theory, many of these research roles require a </span><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-science-in-computer-science-boston-5238/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">master’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/program/computer-science-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">P.h.D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in computer science.</span></p>
