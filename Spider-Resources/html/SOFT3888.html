                        Brief Handbook Description: The Software Development project will provide students an opportunity to apply the knowledge and practise the skills acquired in the prerequisite and qualifying units, in the context of designing and building a substantial software system in diverse application domains including life sciences. In particular, students will need to demonstrate sensible application of software development knowledge and skills in their project including deciding on and implementing most suitable software design and architecture, appropriate testing techniques, coding with maintainability and extensibility in-mind, and realizing relevant systemâ€™s non-functional properties including performance, security, reliability, and usability. Student will also need to demonstrate the proper use of software development tools and practices that lead to effective and efficient development processes. Working in groups for an external client combined with academic supervision, students will need to carry out the full range of activities including requirements capture, analysis and design, coding, testing and documentation. Students will use the XP methodology and make use of professional tools for the management of their project.
