        <h3><strong>User Experience </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User experience (UX) roles involve working with products—including those which incorporate AI—to ensure that consumers understand their function and can easily use them. Although Edmunds emphasizes that these roles do exist outside of the artificial intelligence sector, the increased use of AI in technology today has led to a growing need for UX specialists that are trained in this particular area.</span></p>
<p><b>Responsibilities: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, user experience specialists are in charge of understanding how humans use equipment, and thus how computer scientists can apply that understanding to the production of more advanced software. In terms of AI, a UX specialist’s responsibilities may include understanding how humans are interacting with these tools in order to develop functionality that better fits those humans’ needs down the line.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Did You Know: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most prominent examples of how user experience influenced technology we know today is Apple. The invention of Mac operating software—compared to Windows—came from the need for a product that was more user-friendly and which didn’t require an advanced technical understanding to operate. Apple approached the development of the iPhone in the same way. “The iPhone was all about user experience,” Edmunds says. “That was a [user experience expert] understanding how people interact [with their phones], including what’s intuitive and what’s not. Then they designed the best possible phone to fit those needs.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Job Outlook: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The job outlook for user experience designers is quite positive. The average salary for UX designers is </span><a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=User_Experience_Designer/Salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$73,971 per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (though those at the top of their field make over $100,000 annually). Job growth in this industry is expected to increase by </span><a href="https://money.cnn.com/pf/best-jobs/2012/snapshots/43.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">22.1 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2022, effectively increasing opportunities for those with the right training and experience.</span></p>
<p><b>Education &amp; Training: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earning a </span><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-science-in-computer-science-boston-5238/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">master’s degree in computer science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be beneficial for those looking to pursue a career in user experience for technology.</span></p>
