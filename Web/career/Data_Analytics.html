        <h3><strong>Data Analytics</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With data at the heart of AI and machine learning functions, those who have been trained to properly manage that data have many opportunities for success in the industry. Though </span><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/what-does-a-data-scientist-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a broad field, Edmunds emphasizes the role that </span><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/what-does-a-data-analyst-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data analysts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> play in these AI processes as one of the most significant. </span></p>
<p><b>Responsibilities: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data analysts need to have a solid understanding of the data itself—including the practices of managing, analyzing, and storing it—as well as the skills needed to effectively </span><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/communicating-with-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicate findings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through visualization. “It’s one thing to just have the data, but to be able to actually report on it to other people is vital,” Edmunds says.</span></p>
<p><b>Job Outlook: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data analysts have a positive career outlook. These roles earn an average salary of </span><a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Data_Analyst/Salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$59,614 per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and by 2020, there will be roughly </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/05/13/ibm-predicts-demand-for-data-scientists-will-soar-28-by-2020/#190b8a777e3b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">700,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> additional data-related job openings.</span></p>
<p><b>Education &amp; Training: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those looking to excel in the field of analytics as it relates to AI and machine learning should consider either a </span><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-professional-studies-in-analytics-online-14942/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">master’s degree in analytics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a </span><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-science-in-computer-science-boston-5238/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">master’s degree in computer science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a specialization in data science.</span></p>
