                        Brief Handbook Description: This unit introduces students to the fundamental principles that underlie professional practice in computing. It lays the foundation for later studies, and presents to the students challenges common to a multidisciplinary IT environment. The subject also provides students with the opportunity to develop important attributes such as communication skills, an understanding of professional ethics, and of working as a part of a team. Tool use is an important aspect of this unit: students are required to learn to use tools for planning and completing work, managing artefacts including reports, and communicating within the team. A selection of guest speakers will address students on different career paths.
